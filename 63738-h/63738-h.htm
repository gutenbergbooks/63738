CHURCH.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> human affairs, when attention is
powerfully attracted to some question of absorbing interest, the
effect frequently is as though one half only of the subject were
visible to the eyes of the understanding.&nbsp; The mind fixes on
some peculiar point.&nbsp; On that a partial light is exclusively
cast; till in time it is discovered that others, consigned for a
while to an unnatural obscurity, are in reality of greater
moment.&nbsp; They have quietly grown in importance&mdash;like
hardy trees unnoticed by the planter, as not requiring his
care&mdash;till they are suddenly developed in their true
character and vigour, to the astonishment of those who had
overlooked them; and demand, if it be not too late, the deepest
attention and the most active intelligence to control or direct
them.</p>
<p>While Charles I. and Archbishop Laud were absorbed in maturing
their favoured plans for Church and State, opposite and
deeply-rooted opinions, whose force they never paused to
appreciate till it was useless, were ripening all around them;
and their lives became a sacrifice to their blindness.&nbsp;
While James II. was only intent <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>upon enforcing the dictates of his own
one-eyed bigotry, the Revolution was already accomplished in the
hearts of his people; and William III., the instrument to realize
their wish, was almost at the gates of London.&nbsp; While Mr.
Canning was delighting the electors of Liverpool with his
eloquent, and to them convincing, denunciations against the
minutest change in the parliamentary representation of this
nation; while he was admonishing them, with a wisdom then
esteemed oracular, &ldquo;<i>Spartam nactus es</i>, <i>hanc
adorna</i>,&rdquo; a few brief years were to give us almost a new
Sparta; new electoral departments; new laws and forms of
election; new qualifications, and thus new constituents; and,
more than all, new influences upon electors and the
representatives elected.</p>
<p>And thus, as it appears to the writer, will it come to pass
with respect to the subject now to be briefly considered.&nbsp;
While the minds of the most able divines in our nation are bent
to one point; are engrossed in discussing the meaning of our
Confession of Faith, the interpretation of our Articles of
Religion; they are imperceptibly nourishing the growth of a
conclusion more irresistible and more unmanageable than even all
the complicated questions now so eagerly debated: for they are,
by their differences and divisions, demolishing the whole force
of the solemn assent required to that confession.&nbsp; Amidst
the present confusion of tongues, the language of our Articles
has still less than it ever had a definite meaning.&nbsp;
Subscription, instead of being the tie which is to bind people to
certain opinions or truths, is become a rope of sand.&nbsp; So
uncertain is the trumpet&rsquo;s sound, that it no longer, as of
old, proclaims the spirit of <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>an united host, but turns every
man&rsquo;s sword against his fellow: and Englishmen must soon
awake to the conviction that Subscription, according to the plain
meaning of words, is blown to the winds, and become the disgrace
and not the safeguard of the English Church.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When the Saviour of mankind was about to leave this
earth, He consoled his dejected followers with the promise of a
gift which should even compensate for His loss, and exercise a
special influence upon Christians in all future ages of this
world&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I go not away the
Comforter will not come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And He then announced one
of the purposes for which He should come.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall
guide you into all truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all the qualities which
can elevate the character and enlarge the usefulness of man,
truth is the most lovely and powerful.&nbsp; If it be asked, what
is, in briefest terms, the occupation of the ministers of Christ,
it is, to exhibit truth to their people: and, in all their
teaching, this it is which will establish their influence over
the human heart, or at least that without which no wholesome
influence can be exerted, namely, that each is a lover of
truth.</p>
<p>But how is truth to be conveyed from man to man?&nbsp; Only
through the medium of language.&nbsp; And what is language?&nbsp;
A set of signs, or sounds, or words, which by general use and
agreement mean certain things.&nbsp; But all human provisions are
imperfect, and language is imperfect: and words may be artfully
put together so as to have one meaning with the speaker, and
another to the hearer; or written language may be twisted from
its primary sense, and forced to a use contrary to the intention
of the writer.&nbsp; Yet truth is a real thing, and every <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>honest man
knows that it is so; for whoever speaks that to another which he
knows is not understood in his own sense by the hearer; whoever
twists written language from the plain purpose of the writer;
whoever, by a studied obscurity, veils his real opinions in order
to mislead others, is a liar.&nbsp; Let no one be offended by a
plain term which Scripture sanctions.</p>
<p>He who is justly branded with the imputation of such a vice as
falsehood, is, in the common estimation of the best part of
society, contemptible.&nbsp; But if a minister of the Gospel, a
divinely commissioned teacher of truth, shall expose himself to
such an imputation; if, in so solemn an act as Subscription to
Articles of Faith, or in the interpretation of them, the plain
meaning of words is evaded, or a sense put upon them which in
common discourse between man and man would be deemed
dishonourable and wicked, the character of that person as a
teacher of truth must be damaged, and his influence
impaired.&nbsp; He may indeed be surrounded by a set of admirers
captivated by his talents, and their applauses may preserve his
self-complacency, but the final verdict will yet be against
him.&nbsp; It is possible that this error of the mind may arise
from self-delusion, and then the guilt is diminished, but an evil
result must still ensue; for as the root is so will be the plant,
and good fruit cannot grow out of falsehood or
dissimulation.&nbsp; If we remove the case from one individual to
numbers, the general effect will of course be proportionably
worse, and the conclusion will be drawn that <i>many</i> of the
appointed teachers of truth are not lovers of truth.</p>
<p>We may take, however, a less extreme case, and <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>suppose only,
that amongst the teachers of truth a great difference of opinion
has arisen as to some of the doctrines of which they are called
upon to treat, as to the Confession of Faith which they have to
maintain, and as to the terms of the Subscription by which they
declare their assent to it.&nbsp; Then the conclusion will
be&mdash;<i>when this difference is brought in glaring colours
before the public eye</i>&mdash;either, that the Confession
itself, or the form of assent, is so obscurely worded that it
cannot be understood; or that they are intolerable to the
conscience of many subscribers, and so must be somehow evaded; or
lastly, that words, to which a definite meaning has been assigned
in past ages, have now lost that meaning; and that the learned,
the pious, the teachers of the nation, are incapable of
discovering and fixing the sense which they are now to bear.</p>
<p>Let it be fairly considered how far the present state of
things in this nation agrees with any of the cases above
supposed: and if it does so agree, then it is maintained that, on
the principle of a sacred love for truth, Subscription is become
the disgrace of the English Church.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It cannot be argued, in mitigation of the supposed
evil results, that the present controversy on this subject is
confined to certain classes of society, the studious, the
well-educated, the members of our Church.&nbsp; Half our
newspapers are teeming with it; some of our periodicals are
almost confined to it; all, it is believed, are occasionally
employed in its discussion.&nbsp; It is finding its way into
almost every class of society.&nbsp; The commercial
travellers&rsquo; room, we are told, has engaged in it, and much
might many a sophistical controversialist learn <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>from that
numerous, acute, and ubiquitous body of men, who know more of the
real opinions of the great mass of the people than any other
class that can be named.</p>
<p>When our Lord remarked, &ldquo;The harvest is
plenteous,&rdquo; He pointed to the multitude of unconverted
souls; and surely England is not without its full proportion of
such, towards whom the most anxious thoughts and zealous
exertions of the Christian minister are naturally to be
directed.&nbsp; The intelligent Christian, the well-affected
churchman, may be ready to make every charitable allowance for
the imperfections of our Church&mdash;though charity is not the
virtue of these days&mdash;but the criminal, the profligate, the
sceptic, over whom it is most desirable, yet most difficult, to
obtain an influence for their good, are proverbially the most
acute in discerning the defects of their appointed teachers, in
noting any inconsistency between the lesson and the
instructor.&nbsp; Suspicion is the very atmosphere they breathe;
and to rejoice in iniquity, especially where there is a
profession of religion, is, alas! too natural and agreeable to
them.&nbsp; In whatever degree then the teacher of truth shall
expose himself to the imputation of a want of veracity amongst
the irreligious, deplorable is it to contemplate the decline of a
wholesome influence which must ensue.&nbsp; The writer has
himself witnessed a lamentable instance of this result in one of
the most accomplished men of late times, now no more, whom he
wishes it were allowable to name.&nbsp; Could some of our
controversialists look into a conclave of youthful profligates,
led on, it may be, by some ingenious sceptic, they would blush to
hear the comments on their own writings; the bitter and
triumphant questions&mdash;What is <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>it which these our discordant and
subtle instructors really believe?&nbsp; Do they believe
anything?&nbsp; They subscribe, and reap the profit.&nbsp; Let
them tell us what this Subscription and these Articles of Faith
really mean, and then it will be time enough for us to consider
about attending to their instruction.</p>
<p>Add to this the obvious reasoning of the dissenting part of
our population.&nbsp; The best amongst them cannot but see some
justification of their own separation from a Church whose
teachers are proclaiming throughout the land, from an hundred
pens, the discordance of their sentiments as to their own
Confession of Faith: not mere shades of difference reconcileable
with a general agreement in its object, but a division for
instance on, to them certainly, a leading question.&nbsp; Was the
Reformation a good or an evil?&nbsp; The more worldly amongst
them of course hail with delight what they will designate as the
quibbles and evasions of men apparently eager to escape the
trammels of a subscription solemnly made, which during three
centuries has occasioned troubles, and persecution, and
separation, and exclusion in the Christian fold, and is yet
further than ever from establishing its professed
purpose&mdash;&ldquo;Consent touching true religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A still larger class, amidst the din of controversy, pick up a
few popular reports which help to confirm their indifference to
religion itself, and their preconceived notions as to
Subscription.&nbsp; These people, they carelessly conclude, live
by it: they wish to receive the tithes, and they must sign the
Articles: now at least we know from some of themselves how much
they believe them.</p>
<p>If these views are correct, and these apprehensions <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>well founded,
may the earnest request of one who has long pondered over these
things in sadness arrest the attention of those who are capable
of providing a remedy!&nbsp; Let not his appeal, in behalf of a
Church in which he sees the elements of usefulness unparalleled,
to the great body of its ministers and members whom he deeply
respects, and in the cause of eternal truth, be deemed an
unfriendly voice.&nbsp; Let him not be considered an enemy
because with faithfulness, yet with humility, he entreats his
countrymen to consider how far Subscription is become the
disgrace of the English Church.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Although the present state of things as to
Subscription is so notorious that it cannot be denied, yet it may
be well to confirm what has been advanced by a few
particulars.&nbsp; The Thirty-nine Articles are our Confession of
Faith, though they are hardly entitled to that appellation, being
drawn up rather to meet a special emergency in the history of
Christianity than to present a <i>complete</i> compendium of
catholic truths.&nbsp; Several points left untouched by them, or
very briefly noticed, require at this time to be strongly
inculcated.&nbsp; They are, however, our only Confession of
Faith, ever to be valued and revered; and it is required that
every clergyman should declare, and subscribe, ex animo, that he
believes them to be agreeable to Scripture.&nbsp; A similar
declaration is required with respect to the Book of Common
Prayer.</p>
<p>It is not the writer&rsquo;s object to point public scorn
against individuals, neither is it any satisfaction to him to
notice at all the supposed defects of other men: rather is it a
source of real sorrow to him to observe how censure has been cast
to and fro, with an unsparing hand, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>by Christian writers and ministers of
his own day and church.&nbsp; He speaks simply for the sake of
truth, and in that attempt unwillingly adduces only what is
necessary to his purpose.&nbsp; He speaks also in very general
terms, considering it sufficient only to allude to opinions which
unnumbered publications have rendered familiar.&nbsp; While the
terms of our Subscription are strong and decided, several
sections of the English clergy embrace a different view with
respect to it.</p>
<p>If there be any conclusion which the history of England
irresistibly conveys to readers of honest minds, it is this, that
our Reformers in forty-two Articles, and afterwards in
thirty-nine, intended to put forth a strong and unequivocal
protest against the errors and corruptions of Romanism.&nbsp;
Much would it have startled them to be told that the time would
arrive when English clergymen would subscribe to these Articles,
and then proceed to contend that they are not to be estimated as
a protest against the anti-Protestant proceedings of the Council
of Trent.&nbsp; They were accustomed, no doubt, to insincere
subscription from men still Romanists at heart; but the deed was
secret, it shunned the light: it was, with a very few exceptions,
practised without open defence.</p>
<p>It is not intended to affirm that an interminable war is to be
carried on by us against the Romish church: rather it is our duty
to desire, without compromise, union with all Christendom.&nbsp;
Subscription alone is now in view; and while that remains as it
is, and English words retain their meaning, and an English
history of facts can be found, and any clear apprehension of the
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>meaning of
truth remains with us, the perversion of our Form of
Subscription, and the misrepresentation of our Articles,
attempted by any who argue that they were not intended to condemn
Romanism, whether as held before or after the Council of Trent,
ought to excite, in every honest mind, an indignation which it is
a virtue to feel, and a duty to express.&nbsp; If it be
questioned where such views have been advanced, it is sufficient
to refer to Tract No. 90, now before the writer of these pages,
though other instances might be cited from authors who have
subscribed the Articles.</p>
<p>If we turn to another section of the English clergy, that most
opposed to the views of the tractarians, however they command our
respect from their piety, and zeal, and hearty attachment to
Scriptural truth and sound doctrine; yet some of them cannot be
esteemed clear of all blame on the question now considered.&nbsp;
The writer can here speak from personal knowledge.&nbsp; In their
views as to baptismal regeneration, certainly opposed to the
strict language of our formularies; in their dislike of other
parts of our services, and sometimes in the disuse or change of
certain terms, is to be found a proof that to them Subscription
is not altogether satisfactory; and the often-avowed concession,
that the excellence of our system of doctrine and worship, <i>as
a whole</i>, reconciles their minds to some imperfections, is
enough to show that, in subscribing, some violence is done to
simple truth.&nbsp; They argue, and justly, that no human work
can literally demand an unqualified approbation, but our
Subscription does require it.&nbsp; Such arguments, then, cannot
be altogether satisfactory to him who uses them, or to many <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>to whom they
may be offered; and truth, it cannot be denied, is to some extent
dishonoured and damaged in their use.</p>
<p>In that section again of subscribers who embrace Calvinistic
doctrines, though the writer considers that some of the Articles
are more unequivocally favourable to them than their opponents,
yet it cannot be forgotten how frequently and decidedly it has
been declared, ex cathedr&acirc;, that theirs are not the
doctrines of the Church of England.</p>
<p>Another large section of the English clergy may be now
comprised under the name of old-fashioned high-churchmen; and of
that title, it is believed, they will not themselves
complain.&nbsp; Many of them would gladly extract the honey from
the tractarian school, without sufficiently considering how
poisonous the plant whose growth they are to some extent
fostering.&nbsp; They insist often on an exact compliance with
Rubrics, and must forgive me for saying that few amongst them
have fulfilled these in their own practice.&nbsp; Till very
lately, it would indeed be difficult to find many clergymen, or
one bishop, within the last fifty years, who have strictly
observed the Rubrics&mdash;still less the Canons.&nbsp; Some of
them speak also of a literal subscription; but here again the
writer can of his own knowledge state, that numbers claim and use
a considerable latitude in subscribing, and are satisfied with
asserting their <i>general</i> attachment to the Formularies of
the Church.&nbsp; Of their Arminian views as to doctrine, it is
hardly necessary to call to mind how much they are opposed to
others amongst their brethren, and, in the writer&rsquo;s
judgment, to the Articles themselves.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>In
another section may be comprised those who desire improvement in
many things relating to the spiritual affairs of our
Church.&nbsp; Some have openly expressed this desire; a far
larger number cherish it in silence.&nbsp; They who have spoken
out have strongly stated their conviction, that a Church, without
the means of even entering upon deliberation as to our general
improvement in its spiritual concerns, is in a false and
unscriptural position.&nbsp; With respect to the Forms of
Subscription and the interpretation of the Articles, some have
formally requested a change, or rather an authoritative solution
of the many doubts and uncertainties which now embarrass the
question.</p>
<p>Thus while we perceive the variety of opinion prevailing
amongst these several sections&mdash;a variety which, were it not
impeded by subscription, would find a harmless or beneficial vent
in a free inquiry after Scriptural truth&mdash;we see also that
from all of them, more or less, Subscription is requiring that
which, in the ordinary affairs of life, high-minded men would
abstain from; namely, the necessity for qualifying the plain and
straight-forward use of language.&nbsp; Is this a condition
favourable to the reputation of teachers of truth; and is it too
strong a conclusion, at least from some parts of the above
account, to affirm, that Subscription is the disgrace of the
English Church?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; It may be well to look at the result of such a state
of things under another view.&nbsp; The differences above
mentioned are now rendered notorious by innumerable
publications.&nbsp; The laxity as to truth, that is with respect
to the Articles, which they display, will be learnt and <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>adopted.&nbsp; It will be justified by the example of
clergymen who are indeed at one time censured by persons high in
ecclesiastical station, yet by others in the same station
applauded or defended, and never authoritatively censured or
restrained.&nbsp; In another age a new set of opinions may arise
equally differing from the literal sense of our Articles and
Formularies.&nbsp; And who, with the precedent of these days
before him, could proceed with confidence against the authors and
abettors?&nbsp; The errors of a Socinian or an Arian may be of a
more deadly character; but neither the one nor the other, in
affixing his own interpretation to the Articles, or in
subscribing with such doctrinal views, would depart a jot further
from the true meaning of words than the author and the defenders
of Tract No. 90.&nbsp; If that tract has driven one reader to
such a conclusion, a conclusion which he states with pain and
sorrow, it may encourage hundreds to the same; and, ere long, an
Arian or Socinian subscription may be as common as in times past
perhaps they were, with this lamentable aggravation, that in an
age of better religious feeling, &ldquo;men of piety and
talent,&rdquo; so publicly designated by Bishops of the Church,
have taught the way to justify the deed.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The manner in which the present controversy is
conducted greatly aggravates its evils.&nbsp; It is not only that
differences exist and are eagerly discussed before the public as
the judge of clerical orthodoxy, but that, owing to its
character, the discussion assumes a peculiarly offensive
form.&nbsp; It is not merely an inquiry after truth in which some
warmth and zeal might be excused, but clergymen are imputing to
clergymen dishonourable conduct: <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>dishonourable on this ground, that a
person holding the opinions impugned cannot be an honest
subscriber, ought not to remain a minister of our Church.&nbsp;
On all sides this discreditable course has been pursued, and it
would be easy to furnish the proofs.&nbsp; The writer is bound
frankly to own that what he condemns in others may be now charged
upon himself; but never would he have entered upon these remarks
except in the humble yet anxious hope that he may induce others
to attempt a remedy for the evil.</p>
<p>Imagine such a state of things in any other profession.&nbsp;
Imagine the Officers of the Army and Navy for years together
accusing one another of dishonourably retaining their
commissions.&nbsp; It is no answer to say that the remedy with
them would be bloodshed, and that this alone restrains their
pens; for this is not the fact.&nbsp; The accused would demand
inquiry and trial, and the scandal would cease.&nbsp; The clergy
enjoy the unenviable singularity of continuing to accuse one
another, of dishonourable conduct; of acting upon mercenary
motives; of a desire to make their convictions somehow square
with their Subscription, that thus they may retain their position
or emoluments as ministers of the Church.&nbsp; The controversy
is disgraced throughout by an irritating reproach against
character, which is neither becoming to the station of clergymen,
or the manners of gentlemen; and degrades a profession which
ought to be the last to exhibit such an example.&nbsp; It seems
to be perpetually saying, such is the sense of our Confession of
Faith; I have proved it, but you are subscribing in a different,
in a false sense.&nbsp; Thus it is that Subscription, in its
present state, has rendered <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>what ought to be an inquiry after
Scriptural truth, a perpetual and disgraceful taunt upon the
honesty of the parties engaged.&nbsp; Character is damaged, or at
least assailed, and no satisfactory result, no remedy ensues.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The circumstance last mentioned deserves
consideration as another cause which, under present
circumstances, helps to render our Subscription a disgrace to the
English Church.&nbsp; Differences as to its meaning abound on all
sides.&nbsp; Even they who uphold and would enforce a strictly
literal subscription are obliged to allow of <i>some</i>
latitude.&nbsp; Yet what is to be the extent of this no one can
say; and in the midst of all this confusion, no one attempts a
remedy.</p>
<p>Let us turn again to the Army and Navy, and suppose their
Officers discussing publicly for several years the meaning of
some of the Articles of War; deluging the country with printed
statements of their differences; banded into parties, each
following the notions of some favoured leaders; attacking not
only the sense but the honour of their opponents; professing
unbounded respect for their generals, and at one moment
pronouncing them almost infallible; yet the next, if they should
offer an adverse opinion, combating it in no measured
terms.&nbsp; Suppose all this, if possible, going on for years
without a remedy, without a decided attempt to devise one.&nbsp;
Once, perhaps, it was the case; and it was at last remedied, so
far as he might, by the strong arm of Cromwell: but no remedy of
any kind is now attempted amongst the clergy.</p>
<p>The Articles of War for the Army are susceptible of an annual
revision, which is to be sanctioned by the Crown, and embodied in
the annual Mutiny Act, and confirmed <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>by Parliament.&nbsp; Those for the
Navy have existed since the time of George II., but they are
modified so as to meet existing views and circumstances, by
&ldquo;The Instructions and Regulations for Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Service at Sea,&rdquo; which are altered whenever deemed
advisable; and by other expedients well known to the
profession.&nbsp; In every other profession, trade, or calling,
and in every legal document relating to them, from a Royal
Charter to a poor boy&rsquo;s indentures, we have a judge or
authority competent to interpret and decide when a doubt
arises.&nbsp; But Christians in England are either too timid or
too indifferent, for wisdom it cannot be termed, to attempt an
authoritative settlement of the discreditable differences and
difficulties arising out of the various interpretations of their
own Confession of Faith.</p>
<p>In assuming that this is not the path of wisdom, we have high
authority.&nbsp; In May 1840, thirty-six clergymen, who saw the
evil in its true light, and it is now immeasurably increased,
signed a Petition to the House of Lords requesting attention to
the subject.&nbsp; It was presented by His Grace the Archbishop
of Dublin to a full house.&nbsp; Twenty-two Bishops were
present.&nbsp; His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury concurred
in the propriety and necessity of some interpreting power.&nbsp;
So also did the Bishops of London, and Lincoln, and Norwich, and
upon this point there was no dissenting voice.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; The present state of Subscription is also
discreditable to the English Church when we consider the position
in which it leaves the Bishops.&nbsp; Whoever wishes well to the
institutions of his country, and desires to promote the peaceful
happiness of the people, will watchfully <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>cherish
respect for all who are in authority.&nbsp; The Christian is
taught to consider them as ministers of God to us for good; and
the clergy are bound, not only by this universal sanction but
also by their Ordination vows, to reverence the Bishops of the
Church; and any circumstance which occasions a breach in this
duty ought to be to them a cause for regret.</p>
<p>There is a popular error that a clergyman, when in doubt upon
any question of Christian faith or practice, has only to apply to
his Bishop, and that he has authority to settle the
question.&nbsp; Some recent writers have helped perhaps to foster
this notion by their ill-considered professions of entire
deference to episcopal authority.&nbsp; No circumstance has
contributed so largely to expose the very limited extent of it as
the controversies of the present day.&nbsp; A Bishop, in fact,
has scarcely any discretionary power amongst the greater part of
the clergy as to questions of doctrine.&nbsp; He can refuse
ordination to a candidate, or a license to a curate, subject,
however, to an appeal.&nbsp; If he should refuse institution to a
benefice, the civil courts would demand the reason.&nbsp; He may
institute a suit for heresy; and this must be proved by a
reference to the Scriptures and four general councils, not to the
Articles or Book of Prayer.&nbsp; Yet of late great deference to
episcopal authority has been expressed, and the Charges of
Bishops have been anxiously looked for.&nbsp; The manner in which
they have been received by some exposes the hollowness of the
deference professed, the absence of the power supposed, and the
true reason for the anxiety to receive them.&nbsp; They are
estimated as the works of partizans in a controversy, not of
judges in a <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>cause.&nbsp; They are extolled by those to whose
opinions they lean; they are criticized without reserve, and
sometimes with very little respect, by any who are dissatisfied
with them.&nbsp; The truth is shown in all its nakedness, that
Bishops have no more <i>power</i> on such questions than other
men, and less influence perhaps than some other writers.</p>
<p>Yet the Bishops of the Church appear to stand somewhat in the
same position as our judges.&nbsp; But how differently are the
<i>dicta</i> of the latter received?&nbsp; Their decisions indeed
are open to argument from their inferiors in the same profession,
but before a superior court, and not by calling on the public to
be the judge of written controversy between the parties.&nbsp;
Their decisions may be reversed by a superior court, but in a
solemn, respectful, and orderly manner, without being rudely
assailed; and the ultimate appeal being to the House of Lords, or
the Privy Council, no judge, who properly feels the liability to
error in the wisest, can sustain a shock to his feelings or
character if such superior tribunals should differ from his own
judgment.&nbsp; Very different, as we have remarked, is the fate
of an Episcopal Charge in these days; and, until the cause is
removed, there is no prospect of remedying a state of things so
discreditable to the Church: the probability is that it will be
worse.</p>
<p>The Bishops, in fact, are endeavouring to settle that which
they have not the power to settle&mdash;the meaning of
Subscription, the interpretation of the Articles, the true
doctrine of the Church.&nbsp; And whoever in a public station
attempts to exercise a greater power than his <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>office
assigns, exposes a weak point perhaps before unnoticed, and
instead of gaining new authority, may lose a part of that
long-established and deferential respect, which is the most
valuable part of all authority.&nbsp; A country magistrate is
discreetly silent when a case is brought before him which the law
does not empower him to decide, and abstains from lowering his
authority by an interference which may be disputed.</p>
<p>It is altogether unsound in theory, and utterly fruitless in
practice, to expect that points relating to doctrine can be
settled by Episcopal Charges dropping one by one from the press,
and unconnected with each other.&nbsp; The interpretation of a
Confession of Faith or of the terms of Subscription belongs to
the Church, in some way represented and convened.&nbsp; An
Episcopal Charge is pastoral advice.&nbsp; When there is in the
Church a proper authority to legislate or interpret, that advice
will be received with respect and thankfulness, and contribute
much in directing the minds of men to a right decision, which is
its proper office.&nbsp; But when it usurps the province of a
judge or legislator, or from circumstances is improperly brought
to stand in their place, it will only provoke the opposition we
now witness, and ultimately lose a part of that just deference
which it ought ever to receive.&nbsp; The recollection that there
is no Convocation or other Ecclesiastical Body competent to
settle the perplexing questions recently agitated, may have
induced the Bishops charitably to venture upon a forlorn
hope.&nbsp; Their Charges however are powerless in the attempt;
and however thankful numbers are to receive their pastoral
advice, yet when we observe the boundless liberty <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of reply, and
the entire want of authority to enforce their conclusions,
respect for the episcopal office almost suggests the wish that in
these days they were not published.</p>
<p>Supposing, however, the case were otherwise; suppose a real
and unbounded deference to the least word of a Bishop to prevail
amongst the clergy and people; suppose that they had each
authority in controversies of faith; what unfortunately should we
reap in the present state of things but increased
perplexity?&nbsp; The judges&mdash;so to term them&mdash;are
divided in opinion; and, though this in the parallel case of
legal judges is stripped of injury by an appeal to a superior
court, the Church possesses no such appeal.&nbsp; In the
meanwhile two-thirds of our Bishops, perhaps, are ranged on one
side in the present controversy, and have spoken strongly.&nbsp;
The remainder have spoken with a leaning more or less strong in
the opposite direction, or are as yet silent.&nbsp; As to
<i>deciding</i> then the true and proper interpretation of our
Articles and Subscription nothing has been gained by Episcopal
Charges.&nbsp; Only the unpleasing truth has been openly
displayed that they may be treated like the pamphlet of any
anonymous partizan.&nbsp; Thus the present state of the question
as to Subscription operates in overthrowing respect to the office
and authority of our Bishops, and this it cannot do without being
discreditable to the Church.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; They who have studied even cursorily the history of
ecclesiastical affairs in England since the Reformation, may
trace in Subscription another circumstance discreditable, if not
disgraceful, to the English Church, and one <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>which present
times bring before our view.&nbsp; The most earnest and devoted
section of the clergy, whatever their peculiar views in past or
present times, have been frequently branded by the imputation of
departing from the literal sense of the Articles, and of the
Subscription required to them and the Book of Common
Prayer.&nbsp; They have been censured also as disaffected to the
Church, sometimes to its doctrines, sometimes to its rites and
ceremonies.&nbsp; The next step has been to speak of them as
unfit to remain in the ministry, and to desire their
exclusion.</p>
<p>No candid man can doubt the piety, the ability, the zeal in
their Master&rsquo;s service, of the puritanical divines.&nbsp;
Yet many of them were excluded at the Restoration, and thus the
Church lost a large body of Christian men, and itself laid the
foundation of a considerable portion of our present
non-conformity.&nbsp; At the end of the seventeenth century, the
eminent divines who attempted to repair by healing counsels the
damage thus occasioned were branded as latitudinarians, and
denounced as disaffected to the Church.&nbsp; In the last century
no attempt was made to turn into a more regular channel the zeal
of Wesley and Whitfield, and their associates.&nbsp; They were
excluded as unsound in doctrine and dangerous to true
religion.&nbsp; With difficulty for a long time did the
evangelical clergy, who sprung from them, maintain their position
as a proscribed race, condemned as disaffected to the Church.</p>
<p>Suppose in all these cases that the charge of objecting to
some parts of the Articles and Liturgy, and to the Subscription
required, were true; yet to what does it amount?&nbsp; With these
assumed errors, did not these <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>persons believe the Bible and love
it?&nbsp; Did they not believe all the main Articles of the
Christian Faith, as taught by the Church?&nbsp; Was it not the
earnestness of their belief which made them what they were?&nbsp;
Were they not the very men, who, by their faith and energy, were
calculated to accomplish the object of the ministry, namely, to
win souls to the Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom, and to form a peculiar
people zealous of good works?&nbsp; What then was the ground of
exclusion or objection?&nbsp; Subscription&mdash;assent to the
Thirty-nine Articles and the Book of Common Prayer, according to
the strict and exact terms imposed by the Church.&nbsp; There was
not an objection, nor even indifference, to the smallest portion
of the Word of God; but in some non-essential points they wished
for alteration or liberty.&nbsp; Subscription caused the
difficulty.</p>
<p>Whatever opinion may be now entertained of the tractarian
party, the praise of zeal, ability and piety cannot be denied to
the leaders of it; yet they are censured as disaffected to the
Church, and their exclusion not obscurely suggested.&nbsp; For
some of their opinions the writer can be no advocate.&nbsp; He
believes them to have fallen into errors equally lamentable and
dangerous if persisted in: yet were the choice given him between
such instructors and others who pass uncondemned in ruinous
indolence and indifference, he would not hesitate in giving his
preference to the former.&nbsp; Nor, when he remembers the want
of earnest men, and the ever-varying forms of human opinion, can
he hesitate in desiring their continuance as ministers in our
Church.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are not only uncertain of finding out
truths, in <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>matters disputable, but we are certain that the best and
ablest doctors of Christendom have been actually deceived in
matters of great concernment; which thing is evident in all those
instances of persons from whose doctrines all sorts of
Christians, respectively, take liberty to dissent.&nbsp; The
errors of Papias, Iren&aelig;us, Lactantius, Justin Martyr, in
the millenary opinion; of St. Cyprian, Firmilian, the Asian and
African fathers in the question of re-baptization; St. Austin in
his decretory and uncharitable sentence against the unbaptized
children of Christian parents; the Roman or the Greek doctors in
the question of the procession of the Holy Ghost, and in the
matter of images, are examples beyond exception.&nbsp; The errors
that attach to the minds of men are numberless.&nbsp; Now if
these great personages had been persecuted or destroyed for their
opinions, who should have answered the invaluable loss the Church
should have sustained in missing so excellent, so exemplary, and
so great lights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since those opinions were open and manifest to the
world, that the Church did not condemn them, it was either
because those opinions were by the Church not thought to be
errors, or if they were, yet she thought fit to tolerate the
error and the erring person.&nbsp; And if she would do so still,
it would, in most cases, be better than now it
is.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Bishop Jeremy Taylor</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our own case, what would be gained by the exclusion of the
persons just referred to?&nbsp; The past may teach us that this
will not silence men earnest in their convictions, or promote the
unity we desire.&nbsp; But, if their opinions are to be tolerated
within the ministry of our Church, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>then, in common justice, and for the
credit of that Church, the stigma ought to be removed which now
attaches to them as insincere subscribers.&nbsp; It is this which
makes the present controversy so bitter and disingenuous.&nbsp;
Remove the irritation occasioned by this perpetual taunt, and is
there not ground to hope that it would settle down into an
unfettered inquiry after Scriptural truth, and that the result
would be a more universal deference to the Word of God?&nbsp;
Such is the trust which the writer cannot but entertain.</p>
<p>To wait charitably in patience and hope on the one hand; and
on the other to concede all that can be conceded without
compromise of truth, for union and unity, are Christian duties;
but it is not the dictate of wisdom or charity to repel hastily
from the ministry, zeal and piety which cannot be spared, and
which the providence of God may eventually overrule and direct to
the great good of the people.&nbsp; And if Subscription involves
us in the danger of repeatedly excluding the most zealous portion
of our clergy, it is a disgrace to the Church which continues to
enforce it.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; About two years ago the writer ventured to name a
remedy for the evils and inconveniences arising out of the
embarrassed state of the Subscription now required.&nbsp; His
proposal was, that a clergyman should subscribe to the Three
Creeds, instead of the Articles and Liturgy, retaining the other
tests or pledges now in use.&nbsp; Within the last twelve months
he has had the satisfaction of observing, that, on an occasion of
great interest to Christians in this and other nations, a plan
very closely resembling this, as he understands it, has been
adopted <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>under the sanction of the highest ecclesiastical
authority.&nbsp; On the appointment of an English Bishop for
Jerusalem, which was effected, as is well known, in conjunction
with His Majesty the King of Prussia, it was determined to make
such regulations that the subjects of that King, employed either
as missionaries or ministers of congregations in Palestine, might
receive the full benefit of episcopal sanction and
superintendence.&nbsp; This was effected in the manner described
by the following Letters, which appeared in the Prussian <i>State
Gazette</i> of July 12th, 1842.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">THE BISHOPRIC OF
JERUSALEM.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Berlin, July 11.</p>
<p>His Majesty has been pleased to address to the minister of
Ecclesiastical Affairs the following orders in respect to the
relations of the Bishop of the United Church of England and
Ireland in Jerusalem with the German congregation of the
evangelical religion in Palestine:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send you herewith a letter from his Grace the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of England, which contains the
definitive proposals respecting the relations of the Bishop of
the United Church of England and Ireland in Jerusalem with the
German congregations of the evangelical religion in Palestine,
which are inclined to place themselves under the jurisdiction of
the latter.&nbsp; You will see from this letter that the Prelate
secures to the congregations of the German Protestant faith in
Palestine the protection and pastoral care of the English Bishop
at Jerusalem, without any other conditions than such as the
exercise of the protection itself requires.&nbsp; <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>The
publication of these proposals will be the best means to dispel
the misunderstanding of some well-meaning persons, and to render
the misrepresentations and calumnies of the evil-minded of no
effect.&nbsp; Though there are at present no German Protestant
congregations in Palestine, but the formation is still to be
looked for under the influence of favourable circumstances, yet
young divines of the German Protestant Church, whom the
increasing interest in the labours of the missions for the
conversion of the Jews induces to go to Palestine, will certainly
think it desirable to avail themselves of the offers contained in
the letter of the Archbishop of Canterbury, to obtain a greater
freedom of action and a more successful result of their labours,
by accepting the protection and care of the Bishop of the United
Church of England and Ireland.&nbsp; I am very ready to support,
in a suitable manner, young divines of this kind, when they have
been examined and found duly qualified, and especially proved
themselves to be thoroughly grounded in the doctrines of the
Protestant faith, according to the Augsburg Confession, and I
invite you to point out to me any such persons.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Frederick William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Minister of State, Eichhorn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Lambeth, June 18,
1842.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&mdash;As it seems to me to be desirable that your
Majesty should be thoroughly acquainted with the relations in
which the German congregations in Palestine will stand with
respect to the Bishop of the United <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Church of England and Ireland in
Jerusalem, I take the liberty most respectfully to submit the
following proposals, which I hope will be agreeable to your
Majesty:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bishop will consider it as his duty to take under
his pastoral care and protection all the congregations of the
German Protestant faith which are within the limits of his
diocese, and are inclined to place themselves under his
jurisdiction, and will afford them all the support in his
power.&nbsp; The German Liturgy, which has been carefully
examined by me, which is taken from the liturgies received in the
churches of your Majesty&rsquo;s dominions, will be used in the
celebration of divine service by the clergymen who are appointed,
on the following principle:&mdash;Young divines, candidates for
the pastoral office in the German Church, who have obtained your
Majesty&rsquo;s Royal permission to this end, will exhibit to the
Bishop a certificate from some authority appointed by your
Majesty, in which their good conduct as well as their
qualification for the pastoral office is in every respect
attested.&nbsp; The Bishop will, of course, take care, in the
case of every candidate so presented to him, to convince himself
of his qualifications for the especial duties of his office, of
the purity of his faith, and of his desire to receive ordination
from the hands of the Bishop.&nbsp; As soon as the Bishop has
fully satisfied himself on these points, he will ordain the
candidate on his subscribing the three Creeds, the
Apostles&rsquo;, the Nicene, and the Athanasian, and, on his
taking the oath of obedience to the Bishop and his successor,
will give him permission to exercise the functions of his
office.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&ldquo;With respect to the confirmation of young persons
of such congregations in Palestine, the Clergyman of the
congregation will prepare them for that purpose in the usual
manner, will subject them to the requisite examination, and
receive from them, in the presence of the congregation, the
profession of their faith.&nbsp; They will then be presented to
the Bishop, who will confirm them according to the form of the
Liturgy of the United Church of England and Ireland.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;With the most profound
respect,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I have the honour to
remain,<br />
Sire,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s most
sincere and humble Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;W. Canterbury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To his Majesty Frederick William IV.,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
King of Prussia.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is of course impossible to suppose that such a step was
taken without much deliberation: and here we see, first, that an
English Bishop, regularly consecrated by the Archbishop of
Canterbury and other Bishops at Lambeth, is authorised to confer
Holy Orders, requiring from the persons ordained Subscription to
the Three Creeds only.</p>
<p>When it is remembered how long the Christian Church has been
divided and rent, and how the Protestant part of it is again
subdivided into numerous sections, sometimes in the same nation,
any approach towards the establishment of a sound and primitive
catholic test, which may enable a larger number of Christians to
enjoy communion with one another, ought to be viewed with <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>thankfulness.&nbsp; More especially ought it to be so
viewed by ourselves, if there be a hope that the example can be
adopted as the means of promoting peace amongst the ministers and
members of the <i>same Church</i>&mdash;namely, our own&mdash;now
so unhappily disunited; and if the great Truths in which they
<i>agree</i> could be thus prominently exhibited to the
world.&nbsp; And, if the rule laid down with reference to our
Christian brethren of the Prussian Church be sound and judicious;
if it has been wisely and charitably selected as calculated to
unite many who have hitherto been separated in communion, though
not materially in doctrine; why should it not be applied to
secure similar advantages amongst Englishmen, and to heal some of
the wounds which are daily inflicted on the peace of the Church
by its own ministers and members?</p>
<p>Let not such a proposal be hastily rejected from an unexamined
apprehension that the doctrines of the Reformation are to be
surrendered.&nbsp; Let it at least be calmly and candidly
considered.&nbsp; The remarks hitherto offered may be disputed as
incorrect; but no one can possibly deny that the state of the
English Church is unsatisfactory, perhaps unsafe.&nbsp; The
writer can in all sincerity declare himself, in the fullest sense
of the word, a Protestant: yet he may, very consistently, with
such a declaration, desire to see Protestants Catholics, and in
fulfilment of the pledge given at ordination &ldquo;to maintain
and set forwards, as much as in him lieth, quietness, and peace,
and love, among all Christian people.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are what
the Universal Church now requires for her prosperity and
success.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>While
the above-named catholic test was adopted to meet the peculiar
situation and duties of the new Bishop in Jerusalem, we see that
it was at the same time provided that candidates for ordination,
subjects of the King of Prussia, should be examined generally as
to their qualifications for the ministry; and also as to their
being thoroughly grounded in the Augsburg Confession, the
foundation of our Articles; and further, that a certificate of
their having satisfactorily passed such an examination should be
laid before the Bishop of Jerusalem, who will also take care to
convince himself of their fitness to receive ordination at his
hands.</p>
<p>If we were to transfer this whole precedent, as the writer
understands it, to our own Church, the change it would make would
be simply this, namely, that it would be left to the Bishops,
each exercising the discretionary power now vested in him, to
judge, upon examination, of the doctrinal views of a candidate,
instead of requiring him to subscribe to the Thirty-nine
Articles.&nbsp; And if we draw this out into practice, the loss
as to security for any particular doctrines would be none.&nbsp;
Each Bishop would of course exercise the discretionary power as
he now does, and the same candidates would be admitted; but the
evils now attending upon Subscription would be remedied, or
immeasurably diminished.</p>
<p>A candidate would be examined as to his general
qualifications, and also by questions on the Thirty-nine
Articles, according to the judgment of each Bishop, and might be
received or rejected, as is now the case.&nbsp; Whatever point in
the Articles might appear to each Bishop to require particular
attention would be made a subject of <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>examination, as is now the
case.&nbsp; Any question relative to doctrinal views, deemed
necessary, might be put, and the Bishop would have the actual
view of the candidate in his own words; and, if his word will not
bind a man, will his signature?&nbsp; If a candidate, for
instance, professed that he considered the Reformation injurious
or imperfect, the Bishop might reject him, or not; and if he did
not profess this, but afterwards came to that opinion, the case
would only be as it is sometimes now.&nbsp; Possibly Bishops
might differ as to their mode of conducting such examination; and
in one diocese a candidate might be received who might fear being
rejected in another; for so it has been, and may be again; and
thus persons of various shades of opinion are admitted to the
ministry, probably to the benefit of the Church.</p>
<p>After examination, and previous to ordination, each candidate
would subscribe to the Three Creeds, <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a> and engage to
conform to the Liturgy.&nbsp; At his ordination, as a priest, he
would promise before the congregation to study the Word of God,
to teach nothing contrary to it, and to fulfil the duties of the
ministry according to the solemn and comprehensive pledges of our
Ordination Service, to which the writer requests a particular
attention in connection with this subject.&nbsp; There is here no
want of security so far as pledges can give it; and every
advantage <i>really secured</i> on the present plan would be <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>retained.&nbsp; The present Subscription does not
produce consent touching true religion, whereas an assent to the
doctrine of the Creeds would be almost catholic.&nbsp; The
present Subscription does not secure attachment to the doctrines
of the Reformation.&nbsp; What advantage then does it realize
which would be lost on the plan proposed?&nbsp; They who love the
Reformation and revere our Articles, would love and revere them
still.&nbsp; It is not Subscription which draws forth their
attachment, but conviction&mdash;the conviction that they are
founded on the Word of God, coupled with a thankful recollection
of the men and the times which gave them to us.</p>
<p>Let it not be forgotten that, whatever power the laws now give
for restraining or punishing those who impugn the Articles or
Liturgy, would remain untouched.&nbsp; And in all cases where the
law does speak, it ought to be the test of wrong doing.&nbsp; So
long as it was not called forth, the just presumption would be
that no such offence had been committed; and controversy, which
must always exist while truth is loved, would be carried on
without the discreditable concomitants detailed above.</p>
<p>The precedent adopted then, on the appointment of a Bishop for
Jerusalem, suggests an unobjectionable improvement; <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a> and it carries with it this further
recommendation that it would bring the law and the practice <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>together,
which is always considered sound legislation when the practice
has become so established that the law is virtually
repealed.&nbsp; Instances of this kind are well known.&nbsp; The
repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts was little more than a
formal abrogation of a law no longer in force; and the repeal of
the present form of Subscription would, in like manner, only
legally confirm that latitude of interpretation with respect to
it which already prevails. <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a></p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>11.&nbsp; If, however, the above-named precedent be
rejected, there are yet unquestionable grounds for desiring that
something should be done in the present state of things.&nbsp; It
is asked, not in a hostile or unreasonable spirit, but seriously,
soberly, and earnestly&mdash;for the peace of the Church; for the
credit of its ministers and members; and for the sake of truth
itself&mdash;that we may be told in what sense Subscription may
be, or ought to be, made.&nbsp; It has been of late advanced as
an argument against those who would set up various human
authorities as arbiters of truth; that the Church has already
declared the truth by her interpretation of Scripture, that she
has given us that interpretation in our Thirty-nine Articles, and
bound it upon us by Subscription.&nbsp; We answer simply, that
the interpretation itself is disputed, that the sense of it
cannot be fixed.&nbsp; We want, therefore, a new decision.</p>
<p>It has been argued again that Subscription preserves truth
within the Church.&nbsp; We simply ask, <i>what</i> truth? and
affirm that the constant use of our Liturgy preserves pure
doctrine more effectually, and always will.&nbsp; It has been
advanced also, somewhat inconsiderately, but by high authority,
as an argument against alteration, that any change might make
matters worse, by making Subscription more strict.&nbsp; We
answer that, if it requires an assent to that which is
scripturally true, it cannot be too strict.&nbsp; Let it then be
strictly and literally enforced: but, if this be deemed
unadvisable or impossible, let it be interpreted anew, or
repealed.&nbsp; In its present state it cannot be too plainly or
repeatedly affirmed, that it is a disgrace to the Church.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>12.&nbsp; It may be pronounced absurd or presumptuous in
an individual to propose a change in such a matter as
Subscription to Articles of Faith, but in truth <i>a great change
has already taken place</i>.&nbsp; There have been in past ages
considerable variations as to doctrinal views prevailing at
different times: of late a new character has been given to
Subscription; new certainly to this generation, and new
altogether, as proceeding from persons remaining in the ministry;
for the principal abettors of similar views in past times are
found amongst the non-jurors, and were seceders from the
establishment.&nbsp; A few years ago it was pronounced by a
Bishop to be little less than a libel on the Church, to say that
the clergy did not subscribe literally to the Articles.&nbsp;
Since that time another Bishop has designated a system of
interpretation put forth and defended by clergymen, as &ldquo;so
subtle, that by it the Articles may be made to mean any thing or
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Several episcopal charges have spoken to
the same effect, and almost innumerable publications from other
authors.&nbsp; Yet the principles on which that system is
founded, are disseminated with unabated zeal and increased
influence.&nbsp; The Tracts for the Times, silenced only by name,
are issued in reviews, magazines, pamphlets, poems, and novels;
and the same views as to the Reformation and the Articles are
maintained, though the application of them, in the manner
proposed by Tract No. 90, may be partially disowned.&nbsp; A
<i>great change then has taken place</i>; and the result is, that
Subscription has received a blow from which it can never recover
without some decided measure.&nbsp; It must become an object of
general ridicule or contempt, <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of which, indeed, some indications
have already appeared.</p>
<p>To this the writer desires to invite attention.&nbsp; If he
has ventured to propose a remedy, it is principally on this
ground, that whoever points out a defect in existing institutions
is commonly asked, what improvement can you offer?&nbsp;
Although, then, convinced that the remedy he has named is
calculated to meet the evil, it is rather his wish that others
should be induced to come forward, and so to deal with the change
which has taken place that it may cease to be a reproach to the
Church.&nbsp; With this object before him, he believes himself
engaged in the cause of truth, and will continue to devote to it
the limited powers he possesses while life is spared.&nbsp; And
let it not be deemed presumptuous if, under an humiliating sense
of his own insufficiency, he yet perseveres in recommending what
is so far beyond his power to accomplish.&nbsp; No one can
reasonably expect visible success in any undertaking.&nbsp; It is
enough to enjoy the assurance that we are persevering in a right
path.&nbsp; The result may well be left to the Supreme Disposer
of all things.&nbsp; Nor are instruments in His hands weak, as
man estimates power; but the weakest may be permitted to sow the
seed destined to bring forth much fruit.&nbsp; It is the progress
of conviction wrought in the minds of men which prepares the way
for improvements.&nbsp; It is the open statement of these
convictions, here and there, which leads to action.</p>
<p>Few improvements, if any, in the moral world can be
novelties.&nbsp; They are only a return to some good old
principle which the great innovator, time, or rather the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>great
deteriorator, human corruption, hath thrown into the shade.&nbsp;
An age there was, perhaps a better than this, when human Articles
were unknown to the Church; an age also when the shortest of our
Creeds sufficiently expressed the faith of a believer.&nbsp; It
does not require learning or talent to state all this, and to beg
others to recollect that, if heresies call for Articles, a folio
would scarcely suffice.&nbsp; Simple minds may state such simple
truths, and God may cause their voice to be heard.</p>
<p>Nor can it be justly affirmed that, to expose even in strong
terms prevailing defects, is any proof of disaffection to the
Church in which they exist.&nbsp; The writers of Scripture,
although Divinely inspired, are yet a pattern to their less
favoured followers.&nbsp; And who can peruse the writings of the
Prophets and Apostles without being struck by their bold and
uncompromising denunciations of the sins and errors prevailing
amongst high and low, learned and ignorant, teachers and
people?&nbsp; If it be disaffection to the Church, to describe
faithfully and plainly an evil which requires a remedy, then is
Isaiah to be condemned in his first chapter, and St. Paul in his
most celebrated Epistles, instead of being our examples and
instructors in the path of ministerial duty.</p>
<p>If the remarks above offered be well founded, they cannot be a
matter of indifference, for they affect all to whom truth, and
religion, and the credit of its ministers, and the national
honour are dear: and all such might, without compromise of any
principle or opinion, as the writer believes, join in an address
to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>To Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, over all
persons and in all causes Ecclesiastical and Temporal within Her
Dominions supreme.</p>
<p>We your Majesty&rsquo;s faithful subjects have observed with
pain the Controversies now for some time carried on with respect
to the true interpretation of the Thirty-nine Articles of
Religion and of the Subscription by law required to them and to
the Book of Common Prayer; and we humbly pray your Majesty to
institute such measures as to your wisdom shall seem fit, with
the advice of your Majesty&rsquo;s Privy Council, in order to
provide a remedy for the uncertainty prevailing upon this
subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span><span
class="smcap">It</span> is with reluctance that I add to the
above remarks any that relate merely to myself.&nbsp; Some
circumstances, however, appear to require a few brief
observations.</p>
<p>In a former publication on the Meaning of Subscription, <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> occasioned by the extreme uncertainty
and perplexity in which this subject is involved, I stated my
readiness to resign my preferment, if called upon to do so within
a certain time by His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp;
That call has not been made.&nbsp; It may, however, be supposed
that the remarks now offered on the same subject are published,
not so much with a view to any general improvement as from a
desire to obtain relief for my own difficulties.&nbsp; I wish
therefore distinctly to state that this is not the case, and that
those difficulties are removed, for the present, on the following
grounds.</p>
<p>Within the last three years a departure from the plain and
obvious meaning of the Articles has been displayed, to an
unparalleled extent, amongst the ministers of our Church; yet no
call has been authoritatively made upon any of them to resign,
and they retain their situations, with the exception of two or
three who have voluntarily seceded.&nbsp; In this state of
things, I can hardly imagine any diversity of opinion with
respect to the Thirty-nine Articles which calls for the
resignation of a clergyman; <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>indeed, it appears to me that it
would be simply absurd in any one to resort to such a step,
unless under a decided wish for communion with some other church
or body of Christians.</p>
<p>It can hardly be necessary to say, after what has been already
offered, how far I am from desiring that such a state of things
should continue, however unfavourably a change might affect
myself: for I still maintain,&mdash;</p>
<p>That the condemnatory clauses of the Athanasian Creed, in
their literal sense, are an un-Christian appendage to a document
of extraordinary merit, yet such that a true Christian may
innocently differ from some propositions set forth in it.</p>
<p>That a Bishop is not authorized by the Gospel to address a
candidate for Ordination in the literal sense of the words,
&ldquo;Receive the Holy Ghost: whose sins thou dost remit, they
are remitted, and whose sins thou dost retain, they are
retained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That a Christian minister is not authorized by the Gospel to
address any one in the literal sense of the words, &ldquo;I
absolve thee from all thy sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entertaining these views, I yet venture to conclude that I
could subscribe the Articles and Liturgy with as near an approach
to a literal assent as most of the clergy, and certainly with a
far more cordial approbation of them than many who might be
named.&nbsp; It has been said that the objections just mentioned
are trifling.&nbsp; Whoever has marked the course of the
controversy now existing in our Church will see how great a
stress has been sometimes laid on two of the above points, as
materially supporting the views of tractarian writers.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>I have
now only to acknowledge the comments of several clergymen and
others in this diocese upon my last publication.&nbsp; To the
Rev. B. Philpot, formerly Archdeacon of the Isle of Man, and to
the Rev. C. Green, Rector of Burgh, I beg to offer my sincere
thanks for the candid and Christian spirit in which their
observations were made.&nbsp; I avail myself also of this
opportunity to acknowledge with respect and gratitude a large
number of private communications, both from friends and
strangers, which were a valuable testimony at a period when they
were most acceptable.</p>
<p>There are a few whom I have also to thank for having placed
before me every fault in my conduct, and every objection to my
statements, which, I conclude, from the tenour of their remarks,
could be discovered or supposed.&nbsp; It is related, I think, of
Archbishop Tillotson that he had in a conspicuous part of his
library a collection of remarkably bound books; and that, on a
friend inquiring what they were, he answered, &ldquo;Those are my
best friends&mdash;the authors who have written against
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the same feeling, I beg again to thank the
writers last mentioned; though I must express my regret that
Christians should write in a spirit so unbecoming, according to
my view, in a true follower of the Gospel of Christ.</p>

<p><a name="footnote33"></a><a href="#citation33"
class="footnote">[33]</a>&nbsp; In proposing this test, it is
assumed that the view of the late Professor of Divinity, Bishop
Marsh, with regard to the condemnatory clauses attached to the
Athanasian Creed, would be thenceforward considered as
established in our Church.&nbsp; His words are, &ldquo;I do not
mean to defend those anathemas.&nbsp; They are no part of the
Creed itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote34"></a><a href="#citation34"
class="footnote">[34]</a>&nbsp; The establishment of such a test
in our own Church might materially assist, as an example, in
securing a great collateral benefit.&nbsp; They who are
interested in missionary exertions know how great an impediment
to their success arises from the differences and divisions
amongst the ministers sent forth from various churches and
societies.&nbsp; One mischievous effect of these is, that the
general consent <i>which really exists</i> as to catholic truths
is <i>obscured</i>.&nbsp; The differences on other points are
always on the surface.&nbsp; Thus they command an undue degree of
attention and importance; and, not to mention other evils, the
conclusion must occur to unbelievers, that no one certain system
of truth can be collected from that which is proposed to them as
a Divine Revelation.</p>
<p>To separate the points of difference from the common bond of
union, by affixing some <i>decided</i> mark of preference and
distinction on the latter, would be something gained in attempts
to evangelize the world.&nbsp; It might be better still, if one
Creed, the Nicene, were chosen as the test.&nbsp; A very large
proportion of Christian missionaries, it is presumed, would
cordially bear testimony to its truth.&nbsp; Thus it would
present some common bond of union amongst them in
&ldquo;preaching the Gospel to all nations&rdquo;&mdash;an
imperfect one, it may be said, yet apparently the best which can
be secured.&nbsp; For almost every doctrinal point beyond that
Creed is controverted; and, at the end of eighteen centuries,
every church must be content to see its distinctive claims to
reception rest on argument rather than authority.</p>
<p><a name="footnote35"></a><a href="#citation35"
class="footnote">[35]</a>&nbsp; Private opinion, or judgment, it
is very clear, cannot be controlled by Subscription, or by any
other means; yet peace might be preserved, to a great extent, if
the Church had the power to enjoin silence on any particular
point amongst its ministers.&nbsp; In some respects it would be
dangerous to grant such a power; but the wisest human
arrangements are frequently only <i>choosing the least of two
evils</i>.</p>
<p>The recent sentence on Dr. Pusey may be very proper as regards
the religious instruction offered to students at an university,
but will of course decide nothing as to the general
controversy.&nbsp; Only the voice of the Church can effect this,
and it is time that the Church should at least <i>be able</i> to
speak, though its first decision might endanger the existence of
the <i>Establishment</i>.&nbsp; Faith, however, is a better
counsellor than Fear.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
